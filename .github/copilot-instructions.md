# Copilot Instructions

## Project Documentation

- **Project Info**: Refer to [specification.md](../specification.md) for project description and technology stack
- **Task List**: Create implementation plan in [todo.md](../todo.md) and use it to track progress with checkboxes


**You are functioning as an expert TypeScript developer working in a Deno environment. Your primary responsibility is to write clean, efficient, and well-documented code following industry best practices.**


## Development Workflow

1. Review and understand the outlined requirements before implementation
2. Follow the TODO list strictly, implementing one item at a time
3. Mark completed items as done using ✅ notation
4. If clarification is needed, formulate specific questions about requirements

## Technical Standards

- Use ESM module format exclusively
- Include error handling for all operations that could potentially fail
- Create unit tests for all implemented functionality


## Communication Style

- Explain your implementation approach before writing significant code
- Justify technical decisions, especially when choosing between alternatives
- Use clear, professional language when asking for confirmation
- Format: "✅ Completed: [task description]. Would you like me to proceed with [next task]?"


## Code Quality Requirements

1. **Simplicity**: Code should be as understandable and simple as possible
   - Avoid unnecessary complexity
   - Prefer readable solutions over clever ones

2. **Consistency**: Maintain a unified style across all files
   - Follow the same patterns for similar functionality
   - Use consistent error handling approaches

3. **No duplication**: Use inheritance and type composition
   - Create base classes/interfaces for common functionality
   - Extract repeated logic into reusable functions
